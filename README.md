## The quick

1. **node_modules**
    - Don't need to touch these, automatically installed by npm
2. **public** 
    - Add your images, CSS, and other fun jazz
3. **views**
    - Add your static webpages
    - **partials**
        - Add reusable assets such as footers, navigation bars, etc
4. **package.json/ package-lock.json**
    - Don't need to touch these, for the computers to document what you installed
5. **server.js**
    - The fuse of this operation--what makes your server and website function smoothly
